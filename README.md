Final project for mod1 at Turing

I considered my TDD to be pretty poor at the beginning of this project mainly as a consequence of not knowing how to appropriate break apart the class structure for this project.  I had several commits where I changed multiple files at once and that was mainly because I was trying to figure out how classes interact.  I struggled with a good work flow for the command line because I couldn't decide how to approach the problem.  It often felt like TDD was only beneficial with a strong sense of class inheritance and structure.  As such, it felt like a very waterfall process when the agile process was me playing with the classes to see how everything interacted. My functionality is okay for this project, but I lacked a lot in OOP and TDD for this project since I don't know the correct flow on when to break out a module or class or superclass from a working class. Overall, I believe the classes I settled on are well organized now, my version control was very frequent, my TDD was poor, and functionality should be passing. I will continue to work on this project to solve the cracking problem until I get feedback on this.
